Welcome to my website! I am currently a junior at Centre College, double majoring in Mathematics and Data Science. I love playing soccer and video gamesâ€”they are my escape from the constant demands of being a college student, especially as an international student. I hail from Nigeria in Sub-Saharan Africa, and I am the third of four boys. I'm fortunate to have the opportunity to pursue tertiary education here in the U.S.

I've learned and grown immensely since my introduction to Western life here in Danville, KY, and the pursuit of the American dream. Looking back on my formative years, I remember my father always telling me that mathematics is the easiest subject because it never lies. I quickly developed a love for algebraic equations and word problems, which sparked my interest in Data Science and Analytics. A few years into college, my mathematics professor (Dr. John H. Wilson) encouraged me to add a Math major. Though it required extra responsibility, I was confident my passion for the subject was still strong as ever, and looking back, I feel incredibly fulfilled by that decision. As for my refined career path, I am eager to see what the next two years have in store for me!
