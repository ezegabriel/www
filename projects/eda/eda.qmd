Following the commencement of the SURE camp this summer, the program began with a joint lecture session between the sports and health camps. A fortnight into the proceedings, all 30 of us were randomly split into groups of 3.

The project involved showcasing a basic understanding of sports collated data, that can be applicable to solving prospective research questions. My group created 3 simple plots to guide our initial analytics orientation before the final capstone group were to be announced.
